# Pure Python.Numpy Implementations of Simple NN Modules

- Most of the useful implementations is in `layers.py`, `optimizers.py`, and `initializers.py`.

###  Instruction for Training the Model, and saving the predictions

1. First, goto `config.py` in the `Algorithm` folder,
   - change the `Data_PATH` variable to the path that contains the training data and testing inputs (i.e. `train_128.h5`, `train_label.h5`, `test_128.h5`)
     - Default `DATA_Path` setting: `"../Assignment-1-Dataset"`
     - Default Prediction saving path`Save_To` : ``
   - change the `SAVE_PATH` variable to the path to save `Predicted_labels.h5`
   - change the `PREDICTING` variable to True
2. Then, simply run `python3 train.py` from the `Algorithm` folder
   - the software would load the training data
   - start training on the training configurations specified in `config.py`
3. After training is done, the `Predicted_labels.h5` file will be saved to the `SAVE_PATH` in `config.py`
4. Enjoy!
